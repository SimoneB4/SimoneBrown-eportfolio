In this project, I chose four images that kind of touch a part of who I am. Purple is my least favorite color in the
rainbow, but I used it because I wanted to appreciate it more. I included a ton of crystals because I believe it
                                        promotes physical, emotional and spiritual healing. Finally, I used flowers because I love flowers of all kinds and hope to create a garden of my own one day.(September 2020) </p>

									<p>
This is my first time using illustrator and I absolutely love it. Creating the vector was easy but I was able to
successfully create many shapes to look like a selfie that I took. I chose the colorful background because
I normally use darker and dull colors. I wanted to step outside the box. The most challenging thing about
                                        this project is keeping my layers neat and labeled(September 2020)</p>

This sound is based on my 21st Birthday, which is one of the most memorable nights of my life. This is because I was able to get all my family together and we partied until the sun came up! Though the sound is brief, I used about eighteen audio sounds. I did not used any effects; I did have to lower some of the sounds, so it does hurt your ears! The most challenging part of this project was placing the audio on top of each other and making sure they do not blend so much that the sound is unrecognizable. To ensure this was not an issue, I balanced each sound by lowering or raising the sounds.(October 2020)</p>

When creating this animation, I knew I wanted to do something Disney related, so naturally I chose Rapunzel. I wanted to capture the "hurt" side of Rapunzel because I was so fascinated with the animated series. I chose the colors based on emotions, I wanted it to be dark and gloomy. It took me about a week to color and probably even longer to animate it. Oh, this is my first successful animation using Procreate 5X. The most challenging part was finding videos to teach me how to animate because this feature is so new.(October 2020)</p>

                                        The cause that I am promoting is saving the world by not littering. I chose this message because I grew up in New York City and noticed over the years that littering is becoming a more serious problem every day. I pretty much drew everything and animated it using Procreate 5X! (Shout out to that program) I hope that people see this animation and it helps remind them that our global warming is affecting us and other creatures of the earth. The most challenging part of this project is determining where the bottle should fall.(December 2020)</p>
